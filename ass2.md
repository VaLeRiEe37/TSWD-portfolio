### Summary

In the realm of data visualization, each method serves a distinct purpose and caters to different aspects of data comprehension. *Bar charts* are quintessential for comparing quantities among discrete categories, making it straightforward to rank and compare individual entities. *Heatmaps*, or highlight tables, excel in revealing patterns and offering a bird's-eye view of data across two dimensions—ideal for spotting outliers and trends over time or across categories.

The *tree map*, which I chose as my third visualization method, juxtaposes against these two by offering a hierarchical view that is space-efficient. It is particularly effective for displaying proportions within a dataset, where each rectangle's size corresponds to its value, in this case, the average debt-to-GDP ratio of OECD countries from 1995-2021. This visual form allows for an immediate, intuitive grasp of each country's fiscal weight relative to others. It conveys not only the quantitative value but also the qualitative status of a country's economy—larger, warmer-colored rectangles signal higher debt burdens, prompting further inquiry into the economic context.

This choice was informed by the interest of global overview, and also the data's skewness and the desire to center the color scale at the median value of 64.19%, which more accurately reflects the central tendency given the distribution. It shows, at a glance, which countries are above or below this median line, revealing economic positions without the need for detailed statistical analysis. In contrast to bar charts that list entities separately and heatmaps that require two dimensions, the treemap compiles all necessary information into a single, easily digestible format.

The data sourced from the OECD is a reliable and comprehensive dataset that tracks various economic indicators, providing an authoritative base for such comparative analysis. This visualization not only aids in my own understanding of global economic health but is also intended to make economic data more approachable for a broader audience, regardless of their background in data analysis.
