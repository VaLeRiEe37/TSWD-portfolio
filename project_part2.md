# Wireframes / storyboards
> To enhance the visual storytelling and structure of my project, I opted to utilize Shorthand for creating wireframes/storyboards at this phase. This approach hopefully not only accelerates the development of the final product but ensures more effective and meaningful feedback during my interviews.

My story outline draft using Shorthand can be viewed below:

# User research 

## Target audience

My project aims to shift focus to a unique angle, showcasing the importance of tree canopy and green spaces from a social security perspective. The primary audience is the residents of Pittsburgh and its neighboring areas, highlighting the growing concern of tree equity and the unequal distribution of greenery, which tends to favor wealthier neighborhoods. While Pittsburghers are at the heart of this narrative, the message extends to a broader audience nationwide. The issues of tree equity and canopy coverage are not exclusive to Pittsburgh; they resonate across the United States. By shedding light on Pittsburgh's situation, I hope to inspire people everywhere to explore and address these environmental disparities in their own communities.

For my project, I focused on choosing interviewees who represent different perspectives related to my target audience. I identified three distinct profiles:

1. Local Experience Insight:

- Interviewee A is a woman in her early 30s, with a background in business and logistics. She has lived in Pittsburgh for six years and has observed the city's tree canopy and equity issues firsthand.
  
2. Environmental Consciousness:

- Interviewee B, a woman in her mid-20s, is pursuing a master's in urban design. She has a keen interest in environmental issues, offering an informed perspective on the importance of urban greenery.

3. Neutral Viewpoint:

- Interviewee C, an early-20s woman with a background in information technology, policy, and data analytics, represents a neutral stance. She has little prior knowledge or strong feelings about tree equity or canopy, providing an unbiased viewpoint on the matter.

To enrich my project, I also ensured that these individuals have experience or knowledge in creating data visualizations. This criterion was important to gather constructive feedback on the clarity and comprehensibility of my visualizations.
