# Wireframes / storyboards
> To enhance the visual storytelling and structure of my project, I opted to utilize Shorthand for creating wireframes/storyboards at this phase. This approach hopefully not only accelerates the development of the final product but ensures more effective and meaningful feedback during my interviews.

My story outline draft using Shorthand can be viewed below:

# User research 

## Target audience

My project aims to shift focus to a unique angle, showcasing the importance of tree canopy and green spaces from a social security perspective. The primary audience is the residents of Pittsburgh and its neighboring areas, highlighting the growing concern of tree equity and the unequal distribution of greenery, which tends to favor wealthier neighborhoods. While Pittsburghers are at the heart of this narrative, the message extends to a broader audience nationwide. The issues of tree equity and canopy coverage are not exclusive to Pittsburgh; they resonate across the United States. By shedding light on Pittsburgh's situation, I hope to inspire people everywhere to explore and address these environmental disparities in their own communities.

For my project, I focused on choosing interviewees who represent different perspectives related to my target audience. I identified three distinct profiles:

1. Local Experience Insight:

- Interviewee A is a woman in her early 30s, with a background in business and logistics. She has lived in Pittsburgh for six years and has observed the city's tree canopy and equity issues firsthand.
  
2. Environmental Consciousness:

- Interviewee B, a woman in her mid-20s, is pursuing a master's in urban design. She has a keen interest in environmental issues, offering an informed perspective on the importance of urban greenery.

3. Neutral Viewpoint:

- Interviewee C, an early-20s woman with a background in information technology, policy, and data analytics, represents a neutral stance. She has little prior knowledge or strong feelings about tree equity or canopy, providing an unbiased viewpoint on the matter.

To enrich my project, I also ensured that these individuals have experience or knowledge in creating data visualizations. This criterion was important to gather constructive feedback on the clarity and comprehensibility of my visualizations.

## Interview findings

Details of the findings from my interviews are shared and summarized below:


| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Does the chosen layout of Shorthand make the story flow well? | Yes, I Liked the platform - never seen Shorthand before, very user-friendly            | Liked the ability to scroll.liked different subsections at the top toclick, very uniform, liked the transition slides            | Yes, easy to scroll, anddon't need to clickthrough anything, thoughtransition slides helpedguide the story            |
| Is the story easy to follow, or were there places that were more difficult to understand than others?                         | Easy to follow                                | Easy to follow, though those maps in the Pittsburgh section are a little hard to understand            | Yes, would like to see more about crimes though            |
| Is the overall story and objective clear? Is there anything you think needs to be clarified more?                        | Yes quite clear. I would say add more about crimes                               | Yes, I like the idea that you want to use the effect of green spaces on crimes to call for people's attention on tree equity             |  Yes kind of, would like to see some specific neightborhood comparisons in Pittsburgh though.           |
| Do you feel motivated to learn more about tree equity or tree canopy in Pittsburgh or your place of choice?                        | Yes for sure.                               |Yes! Would be interestedto know about it inCleveland             |Yes, the findings and results in Philly is inspiring.             |
| Overall, is there anything you would change or do differently? Any final thoughts or recommendations?                        |                      I would say add legend to those maps if possible, and circle/highlight the region (like Downtown Pittsburgh) to make it easy to distinguish.          | The font and color, I think they are not consistent overall. And also I would say add some some titles to the map sections or simply add titles to those maps, so audiences are easy to walk through that section.            | I think you can find a stronger punchline to wrap up the story. And currently the Budget section is the last part before call to action, I think the transition is a little weird.       |
