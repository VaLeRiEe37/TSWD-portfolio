# Wireframes / storyboards
> To enhance the visual storytelling and structure of my project, I opted to utilize Shorthand for creating wireframes/storyboards at this phase. This approach hopefully not only accelerates the development of the final product but ensures more effective and meaningful feedback during my interviews.

My story outline draft using Shorthand can be viewed below:
