# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask.

In designing my Interview Script, I focused on three main areas (2 of which are from the GoodCharts Critique Method, 1 from GoodCharts Chapter 7):

- Design Execution (Aesthetics, Layout of Shorthand, and Types of Visualizations)
- Contextual Awareness (Clarity, Simplicity, Intuitiveness)
- Persuasion and Manipulation (Motivation, Engagement, Learning Experience)
- General Question


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Design Execution: Aesthetics    | Are there any elements that are distracting or confusing such as layout, color, text, font?                 |
| Design Execution: Layout of Shorthand     | Does the chosen layout of Shorthand make the story flow well?                 |
| Design Execution: Types of Visualizations     |   Are the visualizations used appropriate for the data used? Are they clear? Confusing? Misleading?               |
| Contextual Awareness: Clarity     | Is the overall story and objective clear? Is there anything you think needs to be clarified more?                |
| Contextual Awareness: Simplicity     | Is the story easy to follow, or were there places that were more difficult to understand than others?                 |
|Contextual Awareness: Intuitiveness      |  	Is the story intuitive and clear? Are there any improvements that need to be made to the storyboard? Additional information needed?                |
| Persuasion and Manipulation: Motivation     | Do you feel motivated to learn more about tree equity or tree canopy in Chicago or your place of choice?                 |
| Persuasion and Manipulation: Engagement     |  While looking through the storyboard/wireframe, did you stay engaged throughout or were there places where you began to become uninterested?                |
|  Persuasion and Manipulation: Learning Experience    |  Did you learn anything? Is there something else you wish/hope to learn after viewing the whole storyboard?                |
|Overall: Final Recommendations/Thoughts|Overall, is there anything you would change or do differently? Any final thoughts or recommendations?|
