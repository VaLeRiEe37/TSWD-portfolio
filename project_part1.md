### An Outline
- **Introduction**
  - Opening: Set the scene with an engaging introduction about Pittsburgh, its relevance as a vibrant urban area, and the importance of understanding the relationship between green spaces and crime rates.
  - Thesis Statement: Present the central argument or hypothesis that areas with more green spaces in Pittsburgh might correlate with lower crime rates.

- **Contextual Background**
  - State-Level Overview (**Sketch #1**): Begin with a broad perspective, using a hex map visualization to show Pennsylvania's green space distribution and crime rates at the state level. Explain the significance of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh in this context.
  - National Comparison (**Sketch #2**): Transition to a national view, comparing Pennsylvania's green space and crime statistics with other states, establishing Pittsburgh's relative position.

- **Detailed City Analysis**
  - City-Level Distribution (**Sketch #3**): Narrow down to Pittsburgh, using a detailed map to highlight the distribution of green spaces within the city and corresponding crime rates.
  - Comparative Analysis (**Sketch #4**): Use comparative bar graphs to delve deeper into the green space and crime rate data between different neighborhoods within Pittsburgh.
  - Temporal Trends (**Sketch #5**): Present a timeline showing how the development of green spaces and crime rates have changed over the years in Pittsburgh, offering a historical perspective.

- **Discussion**
  - Analysis of Findings: Discuss the insights gained from the visualizations, including any trends, patterns, or anomalies. Examine the relationship between green spaces and crime rates and whether the data supports the initial hypothesis.
  - Implications: Consider the broader implications of your findings for urban planning, policy-making, and community safety.

### Method and Medium:
For the execution of my final project, I've chosen to weave my narrative through **Shorthand**, which is quite engaging and user-friendly. This choice is inspired by exemplary projects showcased in our class, which highlighted Shorthand's efficacy in presenting complex information. My visualizations will primarily be crafted using **Tableau** and **ArcGIS Pro**, tools that offer a robust framework for creating dynamic and insightful data representations. Additionally, to add an element of visual clarity and appeal, I am considering integrating infographics designed with **Canva**. This combination ensures that the visual storytelling is not only comprehensive but also compelling.


The aim is to create a singular, immersive experience where users can access and understand key information about urban green spaces and their impact on community safety, sparking further interest and encouraging them to delve deeper into the subject of tree equity and its importance in urban planning.
