## Green Spaces vs. Crime Rates: A Visual Analysis of Pittsburgh's Urban Landscape

### High-level summary of project:

For my final project, I am honing in on the city of Pittsburgh to investigate the intersection of urban greenery and crime rates, a pivot from my earlier research which explored the broader issue of access to green spaces across Pennsylvania, with a focus on ethnic disparities. This prior work, which utilized geographic visualizations, laid a foundation for understanding the nuances of green space distribution. Now, I seek to narrow my scope, both geographically to Pittsburgh and thematically to the correlation between green spaces and crime rates, utilizing a diverse array of data visualizations and new data dimensions, such as tree cover scores, to delve deeper into this compelling topic.

With the majority of Americans living in cities, the quest for ample and equitable urban green spaces is more than an amenity—it's essential for the collective well-being and quality of life ([citation](https://www.synlawn.com/commercial-projects/urban-hardscape-transformed-into-a-community-green-space/). This project is inspired by studies like the one conducted in Philadelphia's New Kensington neighborhood, where vacant land accounted for an average of 10% of parcels per block, revealing the urban tapestry of undeveloped spaces within a bustling cityscape ([Wachter, 2005](https://library.weconservepa.org/library_items/1032-The-Determinants-of-Neighborhood-Transformations-in-Philadelphia-Identification-and-Analysis-The-New-Kensington-Pilot-Study)). While Pittsburgh-specific data on the relationship between green spaces and social dynamics are scarce, the implications of such disparities as found in Philadelphia provide a guiding beacon for this research. It suggests a pattern that might be replicated or contrasted in Pittsburgh, offering a rich avenue for discovery.

By integrating new forms of data visualizations and leveraging datasets such as tree equity scores, I will probe deeper into Pittsburgh's green infrastructure. The city's progressive efforts to augment green spaces and promote tree equity will be juxtaposed against this backdrop, scrutinizing whether these urban greening initiatives could be a beacon for enhancing public safety and reducing crime rates.

This project is not just an academic exercise but a narrative that addresses an urgent environmental issue with deep societal implications. By highlighting the importance of tree equity, I hope to underscore the role that urban green spaces play in fostering healthier, safer communities.

### An Outline
- **Introduction**
  - Opening: Set the scene with an engaging introduction about Pittsburgh, its relevance as a vibrant urban area, and the importance of understanding the relationship between green spaces and crime rates.
  - Thesis Statement: Present the central argument or hypothesis that areas with more green spaces in Pittsburgh might correlate with lower crime rates.

- **Contextual Background**
  - State-Level Overview (**Sketch #1**): Begin with a broad perspective, using a hex map visualization to show Pennsylvania's green space distribution and crime rates at the state level. Explain the significance of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh in this context.
  - National Comparison (**Sketch #2**): Transition to a national view, comparing Pennsylvania's green space and crime statistics with other states, establishing Pittsburgh's relative position.

- **Detailed City Analysis**
  - City-Level Distribution (**Sketch #3**): Narrow down to Pittsburgh, using a detailed map to highlight the distribution of green spaces within the city and corresponding crime rates.
  - Comparative Analysis (**Sketch #4**): Use comparative bar graphs to delve deeper into the green space and crime rate data between different neighborhoods within Pittsburgh.
  - Temporal Trends (**Sketch #5**): Present a timeline showing how the development of green spaces and crime rates have changed over the years in Pittsburgh, offering a historical perspective.

- **Discussion**
  - Analysis of Findings: Discuss the insights gained from the visualizations, including any trends, patterns, or anomalies. Examine the relationship between green spaces and crime rates and whether the data supports the initial hypothesis.
  - Implications: Consider the broader implications of your findings for urban planning, policy-making, and community safety.

- **Conclusion**
  - Summary of Key Points: Recap the major elements of the story, reiterating the findings and their significance

### Method and Medium:
For the execution of my final project, I've chosen to weave my narrative through **Shorthand**, which is quite engaging and user-friendly. This choice is inspired by exemplary projects showcased in our class, which highlighted Shorthand's efficacy in presenting complex information. My visualizations will primarily be crafted using **Tableau** and **ArcGIS Pro**, tools that offer a robust framework for creating dynamic and insightful data representations. Additionally, to add an element of visual clarity and appeal, I am considering integrating infographics designed with **Canva**. This combination ensures that the visual storytelling is not only comprehensive but also compelling.


The aim is to create a singular, immersive experience where users can access and understand key information about urban green spaces and their impact on community safety, sparking further interest and encouraging them to delve deeper into the subject of tree equity and its importance in urban planning.
