# Changes made since Part II

1. **Visual Consistency:** I've achieved a more unified look by standardizing fonts, themes, and colors. Green is the primary color, symbolizing the project's focus on tree and vegetation protection. Orange, often associated with crime, serves as the highlight color.
   
2. **Responsive Design Adjustments**: 
- Feedback from interviews led to several design changes:I restructured the text layout for easier readability, positioning titles at the beginning and using a dropped first letter in paragraphs. While a suggestion to add a legend to the map was considered, I opted against it due to space constraints and my belief in the map's existing clarity. Instead, I highlighted key neighborhoods in the same orange color for easy identification.
  
3. **Streamlining Navigation:** I removed hyperlinks to external research within the story, except for the final resource buttons. This decision was based on the desire to keep readers engaged with the story, reducing the likelihood of navigating away from the site.

4. **Enhanced Call to Action:** The call to action was strengthened to more effectively encourage participation in vegetation protection, moving beyond a simple appeal to a more compelling invitation for engagement.

5. **Revised Conclusion:** I reevaluated the concluding part of the story. Initially, it suggested a general trend in Pittsburgh of lower crime in greener areas, but closer examination revealed this wasn't always the case. I refrained from drawing a strong conclusion and instead presented two sets of comparative images to show where the assumption holds and where it doesn't. The conclusion now circles back to the government's efforts in vegetation protection and how individuals can contribute.

## The audience

I've continued to focus on the residents of Pittsburgh and its surrounding areas as my primary audience, with an emphasis on the issues of tree equity and the uneven distribution of green spaces. This choice remains rooted in the understanding that while these issues are pronounced in Pittsburgh, they have national relevance, resonating with audiences across the United States.

Throughout the development of my project, insights from interviews and feedback received have been instrumental in shaping the narrative. However, a suggestion to pivot the focus from the relationship between green spaces and crime to a broader theme of tree equity was considered. While recognizing the value in this shift, due to time constraints, I have decided to maintain my original direction for the current phase of the project.

That said, the project is designed to appeal to a wide range of individuals, including those already aware of issues related to tree canopy loss and those new to the topic. The goal is to engage and motivate people to value and protect trees and green spaces, not just for their environmental benefits but from a sociological perspective, highlighting their role in enhancing community well-being and social security.

There are no significant changes to the identified audience or the core message of the project. The aim remains to illuminate the importance of green spaces in urban settings and encourage a broader appreciation and proactive approach to preserving these vital resources.

# Final thoughts

Reflecting on this project, one key realization stands out: the intricacies of factors like income, age, population density, gender, race, and ethnicity play significant roles in understanding crime rates. While my focus was initially centered on the impact of green spaces in Pittsburgh, it became apparent that the influence of these areas on crime is not as straightforward or pronounced as I had hypothesized.

In Pittsburgh's case, the effect of green spaces on reducing crime rates wasn't as impactful or clear-cut as one might assume. This observation has led me to understand the importance of considering a broader range of socio-economic and demographic factors when analyzing such complex urban issues.

Looking back, I wish I had more time to delve deeper into these additional variables and perhaps conduct a more comprehensive, multifaceted analysis. It would have been fascinating to explore how these diverse factors intersect and influence the urban landscape and its safety.

Overall, this project was a journey of discovery. While I set out to explore the relationship between greenery and crime, I ended up gaining a more nuanced understanding of urban dynamics. The realization that the urban fabric is woven from multiple threads – not just the physical environment but also the socio-economic tapestry – was both challenging and exciting. This project has certainly broadened my perspective and understanding of urban studies.
