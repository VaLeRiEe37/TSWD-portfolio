# TSWD-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the course Telling Story with Data at CMUüíª

# About me 
Hi there, this is Valerie and you can address me with she/her pronouns. I'm currently navigating my second year at the MSPPM-DA program, diving deep into the nuances of data science and analytics. Some fun facts: I have two catsüê± (Milo is the youngest and he is a ragdoll. I met him last semester and he is here with me at Pittsburgh, while the other one is in China); I am crazy about diet and body shaping (you can always find me in Hunt library or the gym at CUC); I love traveling and have been to Japan, Korea, U.K., Australia and Singapore. Excited to collaborate and dive deep into data with you all! üìä

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I'm keen on mastering the art of using color smartly in data visualizations to capture attention and convey meaning. With the vast amount of data available today, I believe that the true power lies not just in analyzing it, but in presenting it in a way that resonates with a diverse audience. I would like to refine my skills in crafting user-friendly visuals that resonate with non-tech audiences, making complex data comprehensible and engaging. Ultimately, I hope to enhance my ability to present my work effectively, ensuring that the story behind the data is both compelling and clear to all.
